"KSMod is the longest running and most popular Modification for Guild Wars. Based upon G-Stats, KSMod is a spin-off that enables the UT99 Sound Effects in Guild Wars, adds some graphical effects not available any where else such as High Definition Textures, and it can virtualize the Guild Wars client allowing you to run as many clients as you wish using the same GW.EXE and GW.DAT. The Mod itself is almost as old as Guild Wars, coming out shortly after retail in April 2005. KSMod is used by over 20,000 members of the GW community."

KSMod 3.2 Currently Features:
High Definition Texturing for all Models in all Outposts, Capes Included! (Make sure to use -image command line option)
Multi-Client virtualization
UT99 Sound Effects!
Command Line Switches!

High Definition Textures:

Version 2.x and newer offers the ability to enable High Definition Textures in all Outposts and Areas.

Multi-Client Virtualization:

Version 3.x allows full virtualization of the Guild Wars client, allowing you to run as many copies of the game as you wish. The performance of this method for Multi-Client should be significantly better than other methods that have been offered in the past. There is also a few Disk I/O options included to increase performance even more on newer high memory computer systems.

UT99 Sound Efects:

Every time you get a kill, either in PvE or PvP, you start a new Chain-Kill session. You have up to 10 seconds to get more kills to add to your chain, and every kill you get buys you another 10 seconds. You can chain kills all the way up to 15 (God Like). The order of the kills are as follows:

Headshot
Double-Kill
Triple-Kill
Multi-Kill
Mega-Kill
Ultra-Kill
Ludicrous-Kill
Monster-Kill
Killing-Spree
Rampage
Dominating
Unstoppable
Wicked-Sick
Holy-S***
God-Like
